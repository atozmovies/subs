will then be escorted
to the podium

164
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,915
on the West Terrace, while
you and Mrs. Santos are taken

165
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,183
through the Capitol to be
introduced to the crowd.

166
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,686
Ronna? Speaker Sellner will
deliver the opening remarks,

167
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,272
followed by the Invocation,
followed by performances

168
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:33,595
by Keb' Mo' and Gloria Estefan.

169
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,407
I'm looking forward to that.
HELEN: That's because

170
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,916
you're not gonna be wearing
pantyhose in ten degree weather.

171
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,129
RONNA: Followed by a poetry
reading by Jimmy Santiago Baca.

172
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:43,371
And then, at noon exactly,
you take the oath of office.

173
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:44,617
Followed by a 21-gun salute

174
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,886
and the Marine Band
playing "Hail To The Chief."

175
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,243
Just in case you weren't
feeling important enough

176
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,446
after they gave you the
nuclear launch codes.

177
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,008
RONNA: You then give
your inaugural address.

178
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,093
ANNABETH: And after the
proceedings, you will escort the Bartlets

179
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,551
to the limo that will take them

180
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,380
to Andrews for their trip
home to New Hampshire.

181
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:00,421
Do I get to start
governing any time in here?

182
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,268
As soon as you've
taken the oath of office,

183
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,920
we start moving staff
into the West Wing.

184
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:06,227
Do we really have to go
to nine parties tonight?

185
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:07,645
DONNA: You only have to stay

186
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,158
for 20 minutes or
so... One dance,

187
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:11,827
shake a few hands, then on to
the next. What kind of dance?

188
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,229
ANNABETH: What's the
name of your favorite song?

189
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,330
I'll sneak it to the orchestras.

190
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,499
Oh, no, I am not dancing to
"You Can Leave Your Hat On."

191
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,167
Sir, we should really
head to the church.

192
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,324
Let's get it on.

193
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,637
MARGARET: <i>We're supposed</i>

194
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,438
to leave our credentials
at the front desk

195
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,661
when we exit the building,

196
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,965
and they've asked that we vacate
our parking spaces by 2:00 p.m.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,399
Not a problem, I walked today.

198
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,050
Really?

199
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,402
Yes. I often walk.

200
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,119
You do?

201
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,337
Sometimes I walk.

202
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:36,341
I'm going to walk a lot more
when I get back to California.

203
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:38,137
Los Angeles being
a pedestrian nirvana.

204
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,956
WILL (<i> knocking</i>): That was
disappointing. What was?

205
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,357
You see my final briefing? Nope.

206
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,664
They didn't push back

207
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:43,815
on Pot-Pushing Peggy.

208
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,944
You must be heartbroken.

209
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:46,133
Inconsolable.

210
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,846
There's a train
derailment in New England.

211
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,365
The ice storm? Just
came over on CNN.

212
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,404
CHARLIE: Got a minute?

213
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,190
C.J.: Apparently,
I'm good until 2:00,

214
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,359
and then I've got
to move my car.

215
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,537
Pardon Attorney
brought the warrants

216
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:56,705
for the President to sign.

217
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:57,873
He called her
early this morning.

218
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:59,030
Asked her to add a name.

219
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,952
It's the last one.

220
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,622
You may get your
wish for a final pasting

221
00:10:08,658 --> 00:10:12,093
on national television.

222
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,406
Good morning, Mr. President.

223
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:27,041
Morning.

224
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:28,538
How are you
feeling this morning?

225
00:10:28,562 --> 00:10:29,994
Unemployed.

226
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,657
Lot of that going
around the building.

227
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:32,914
Uh, Dr. McNally is waiting

228
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,326
to give you your
security briefing.

229
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,917
Uh, you asked me to remind you

230
00:10:35,952 --> 00:10:37,563
to write a note to
the President-Elect.

231
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:38,747
(<i> knocking</i>) And Ms. Cregg

232
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:40,249
is anxious to speak with you.

233
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,751
Mr. President?
Good morning, all.

234
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,619
You heard about
this ice storm up in...

235
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,909
New England, yeah.

236
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,756
Unfortunately, the storm
caused a train derailment.

237
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,923
On Amtrak's regional route

238
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,997
between Portland,
Maine, and Boston.

239
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:51,165
Any fatalities?

240
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
13 injuries so far.

241
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:54,146
The worst is a badly broken leg.

242
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,531
But with the extreme weather,

243
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,132
we're going to need an
emergency rescue operation

244
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,500
before everybody
freezes to death out there.

245
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,208
Sounds like a state matter.

246
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,653
Normally, yes, but it's between

247
00:11:01,677 --> 00:11:03,873
the Exeter and Haverhill stops.

248
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,025
Also known as the New
Hampshire-Massachusetts border.

249
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,526
BARTLET: The Governors
are fighting over jurisdiction.

250
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,516
KATE: Governor Sidley says

251
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:09,895
it's New Hampshire's problem,

252
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,097
Governor Wilkins says
it's a Massachusetts issue.

253
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:13,549
BARTLET: Debbie, get the
governor on the phone, please.

254
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,783
Which governor,
sir? Whichever one

255
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,174
you can get on the line first!

256
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,937
WILL: Should we consider
nationalizing the Guard, sir,

257
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,143
send in units?

258
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,272
KATE: Don't you
think that's something

259
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:21,391
a president might want to avoid

260
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:22,558
in his final hours in office?

261
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,665
So we should survey
the accident site

262
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:25,778
to resolve the border dispute?

263
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,179
What are we supposed to do,

264
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,380
send in a team of cartographers?

265
00:11:28,404 --> 00:11:29,581
Both governors
are on the line, sir.

266
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,022
Thank you.

267
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,356
Pick a number, two or four.

268
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:34,232
Two. Four.

269
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:37,461
Governor, call up a Guard unit

270
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,097
and get them to this crash site.

271
00:11:39,132 --> 00:11:42,033
No one gives a damn
where the accident is.

272
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:43,551
Be that as it may, sir,

273
00:11:43,586 --> 00:11:46,287
you are about to
become a star player

274
00:11:46,322 --> 00:11:48,372
in my soon-to-be-written
autobiography.

275
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,858
It's the right decision.

276
00:11:49,893 --> 00:11:51,692
Thank you.

277
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:55,797
Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.

278
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,934
(<i> sighs</i>)

279
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,173
You're hovering, Claudia Jean.

280
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,841
Yes, sir.

281
00:12:06,877 --> 00:12:08,142
What do you got there?

282
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,945
The pardons and clemency
warrants for your signature.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,667
I haven't decided to do it.

284
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:18,269
No?

285
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,805
Do you have an opinion?

286
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:26,411
I'm sure you'll do
whatever you think is best.

287
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,163
Toby's is the last
one in the folder.

288
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,349
Anything else? No, sir.

289
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,285
Thank you, Mr. President.

290
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,469
DEBBIE: Governor
Wilkins is still holding on two.

291
00:12:39,493 --> 00:12:41,992
Tell him I'll be right there.

292
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,048
C.J.: <i>How is the baby?</i>

293
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,989
Wonderful, noisy.

294
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,802
All boy. (<i> chuckles</i>)

295
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,638
Sam's coming back
to work for Josh.

296
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:00,728
Wow, that's great.

297
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,207
How is he? Engaged.

298
00:13:02,231 --> 00:13:03,397
Good for him.

299
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:04,782
Say hello for me, would you?

300
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,545
He's in town; you
can tell him yourself.

301
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,436
Hmm.

302
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:13,925
I've been going
through Dad's stuff...

303
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,126
and I found something
I thought the President

304
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,494
might want to have back.

305
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,458
You don't want to
give it to him yourself?

306
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:21,015
It's a little sentimental.

307
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,366
I'll make sure he gets it.

308
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,239
(<i> softly</i>): Thanks.

309
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,627
Dad loved every
moment he spent here.

310
00:13:39,469 --> 00:13:41,903
DEBBIE: <i>Mrs. Bartlet
called, asked me</i>

311
00:13:41,938 --> 00:13:43,538
to remind you that the Santoses

312
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:48,442
are expected in the residence
in less than 55 minutes.

313
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:51,311
She also asked me to
mention that you need

314
00:13:51,347 --> 00:13:54,832
to leave time enough to
change <i>before</i> they arrive.

315
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,685
Mrs. Bartlet doesn't want
me wearing penny loafers

316
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,187
and a cardigan to the Inaugural?

317
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,888
That's about the
gist of it, yes, sir.

318
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:04,808
Did you write that note to
President-Elect Santos yet?

319
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,428
Saving that for last.

320
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,364
All done.

321
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,667
What about that one?

322
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:14,835
I'm still on the fence.

323
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:17,204
You do realize that you
turn into a pumpkin at noon?

324
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,283
I'm going to take

325
00:14:18,307 --> 00:14:20,808
one final stroll
around the joint.

326
00:14:20,844 --> 00:14:22,838
Make sure nobody's
making off with the cutlery.

327
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,212
53 minutes.

328
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,514
Did he sign it?

329
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:27,749
C.J.: Not yet.

330
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,061
Is he going to sign it?

331
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:30,785
I have no idea.

332
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,119
You think he should sign it?

333
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:33,499
I think the founding fathers

334
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:35,334
left it to the
President to decide

335
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,152
who should and
shouldn't get clemency.

336
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,987
National Guard on the
way to the train accident?

337
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,073
Yep. You know we
probably witnessed

338
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:43,341
the final act of governance
of the Bartlet Administration.

339
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,498
The President serving

340
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,018
as national schoolmarm
on a snow day.

341
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,318
Nice job on Granny Ganja.

342
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,698
I would've thought you
would have gotten a little more

343
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,832
of a rise out of them on that.

344
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:52,206
Yeah, me, too.

345
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,975
You do the flak jacket note yet?

346
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,070
Little writer's block.

347
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,443
Just make it funny.

348
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:58,112
Right.

349
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,308
Let me know if he signs it.

350
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,665
Signs what?

351
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,784
You're a little early.

352
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,352
The Santoses went to church,

353
00:15:05,387 --> 00:15:08,039
so I got an hour to kill before
heading over to the Capitol.

354
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,574
I thought I'd drop by,
and make one last stab

355
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,076
at getting you to stay on.

356
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:17,815
9:30 tomorrow morning
Dulles to LAX, non-stop,

357
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,028
glass of bad merlot,
three bags of peanuts,

358
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,096
and an Ambien.

359
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,187
But thanks for asking.

360
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,922
Danny?

361
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,558
Waiting at LAX with
a tub of sunscreen.

362
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,678
So...

363
00:15:30,713 --> 00:15:31,991
Baker for VP.

364
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,009
You're going to have
quite a battle up on the hill.

365
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,383
Yeah, we're hoping
Vinick at state

366
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:38,402
helps grease the skids a little.

367
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,775
You ever stop thinking
of this as Leo's office?

368
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:47,528
No.

369
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:50,097
Oh, hey, I've got
something for you.

370
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,586
"WWLD"?

371
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,905
"What Would Leo Do."

372
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,328
You're going to do great, Josh.

373
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,713
You don't need me.

374
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:12,186
Morning, Carol. Mr. President.

375
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,632
Thanks you for
all your hard work.

376
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:14,866
Couldn't have
done it without you.

377
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,224
Thank you, Mr. President.

378
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:19,527
Morning, Ray, thank you.

379
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,094
Hey, Carla.

380
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,130
Mr. President.

381
00:16:22,164 --> 00:16:23,631
Larry. Yes.

382
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,511
Going to finally get some
time with the kids now, I hope.

383
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:26,679
Oh, absolutely, Mr. President.

384
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:27,746
Ed, thanks for your help.

385
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,804
No, sir, thank you.

386
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,452
Nancy, how is your mother doing?

387
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,987
She's fine now, Mr. President.

388
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,089
Tell her I'm looking forward
to seeing her again soon,

389
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:38,290
would you, please?
Absolutely, sir.

390
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:40,915
Thank you.

391
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,853
I got to go.

392
00:16:45,888 --> 00:16:47,466
Do you need something,
sir? Heard a rumor

393
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,174
about you and the
Oregon 4th... Any truth to it?

394
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,587
D-triple-C thinks it'll
be a pretty tough race.

395
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,993
Give me a call.

396
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:55,307
I'll come up there and help
you pound in some lawn signs.

397
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:56,630
I'll have a mallet ready, sir.

398
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,785
Excuse me, will you?

399
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,655
Morning, Charlie.

400
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,490
Mr. President.

401
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,570
Have you made a
decision about your future?

402
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,671
Georgetown Law.

403
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,978
You got the early acceptance?

404
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,208
I think the letter from
you may have helped

405
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,265
a little, sir.

406
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:16,667
I don't need this anymore.

407
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,703
I thought you maybe you
could get some use out of it.

408
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,960
I was trying to remember
if my father had given it

409
00:17:25,995 --> 00:17:29,280
to me when I was in the
tenth grade or the 11th.

410
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,999
I considered getting you a tie

411
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:35,853
with the scales
of justice on it.

412
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,889
Figured you'd use this more.

413
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,361
Thank you, Mr. President.

414
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,364
Thank you, Charlie.

415
00:17:57,827 --> 00:18:00,038
Homily seemed a little pointed.

416
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,212
Hmm?

417
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,641
The Cardinal, you don't think

418
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,483
he was pushing the "swords
into plowshares" stuff a little hard?

419
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:08,636
Well, he's right, this
Kazakhstan thing is a mess.

420
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,805
We got thousands of our soldiers

421
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,373
in the middle of Central Asia,

422
00:18:12,408 --> 00:18:14,508
and we haven't a
clue as to what's next.

423
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,244
Nine Inaugural Balls?

424
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,411
You think I'm supposed

425
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,829
to wear nine gowns?

426
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,147
Do you have nine gowns?

427
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,533
No.

428
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:23,688
Well, then probably not.

429
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,022
DEBBIE: <i>19 minutes</i>

Almost done.

Well... that's it.

433
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,342
What about that
final pardon warrant?

434
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:06,455
There's still time.

435
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,211
Not much.

436
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,080
Two hours and 19 minutes.

Aren't you supposed
to be in the residence

440

the Santoses' arrival?

441
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:17,988
Yes. Just leaving.

00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,457
So he keeps saying.

443
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,493
Mallory came by this morning
and asked me to give you this.

444
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:24,729
I was going to ask
Debbie to send it with you

445
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:25,896
on the plane, but...

446
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,759
Why didn't she stop
in and say hello?

447
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,761
I don't think she wanted to
bother you on your last day.

00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:31,585
DEBBIE: 16 minutes, sir.

449

I'm a fast dresser.

450

Not that fast.

451
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,008
Why don't I put this in
your briefcase for the plane.

00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,079
to the farm this evening.

487
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,225
It's supposed to be a surprise,

488
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:31,315
so try and act like it.

489
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,483
Tonight?

490
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,329
I was looking forward
to some peace and quiet.

491
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,765
I know, that's why
I'm warning you.

492
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,240
I don't want you to look
stricken when you see them.

493
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:42,020
Does it have to be tonight?

494
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:43,576
They just wanted to
show you their love

495
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,513
and support in
your hour of need.

496
00:22:46,548 --> 00:22:48,515
They're afraid you might
have some re-entry issues

497
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,583
in returning to live
amongst us mere mortals.

498
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,187
Have I been so out of touch?

499
00:22:53,222 --> 00:22:55,200
When was the last time
you used a telephone?

500
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,467
Or went to a bank?

501
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:57,535
Or drove a car?

502
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,126
It's just like riding a bike.

503
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:00,694
Only more horsepower, right?

504
00:23:00,729 --> 00:23:02,591
GINGER: Excuse
me, Mr. President?

505
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,064
The Santoses have arrived.

506
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,045
They're in the Blue
Room. Thank you.

507
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:08,069
Abbey?

508
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,704
(<i> sirens wailing</i>)

509
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:34,005
SANTOS: <i>Nine Inaugural Balls.
How's that supposed to work?</i>

510
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:35,791
You'll want to skip
the champagne

511
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:37,280
when they do the toast.

512
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,919
I'm afraid I made a bit
of a mess this morning.

513
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,099
It may eat into your news cycle.

514
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,155
Oh?

515
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,757
The pardons.

516
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,558
Granny Pot, I heard.

517
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,874
And a few others.

518
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,448
How's the speech?

519
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,982
It's okay.

520
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:59,503
A couple of good lines.

521
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:02,640
There's no "Ask not what your
country can do for you," but...

522
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,676
JFK really screwed us
with that one, didn't he?

523
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:10,380
Have you chosen a biblical
quotation for the oath?

524
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,282
Kings 3:9-11.

525
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,803
"Grant thy servant
an understanding heart

526
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:17,632
to judge thy people..."?
That's the one.

527
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:18,805
Good choice.

528
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,661
You know what I'm
going to miss the most?

529
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:27,197
Hmm? The Marine Corps Band.

530
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,834
Those guys can really play.

531
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,337
Ask them to do "Semper Fidelis."

532
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,372
They'll knock your socks off.

KILMER: Mr. President.

536
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,366
Senator Wirth will escort

537
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:04,318
you to the podium.

538
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:05,463
This way, Mr. President-Elect.

539
00:25:05,487 --> 00:25:07,532
I guess this is where
our paths diverge.

540
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:09,200
You sure you're ready to retire?

541
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:11,325
See you on the podium.

542
00:25:12,527 --> 00:25:14,527
Mr. President-Elect.

543
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,527
NEWSCASTER:
<i>Capitol Police estimate</i>

544
00:25:18,551 --> 00:25:22,703
today's crowd at over 140,000,
with an additional 800,000

545
00:25:22,738 --> 00:25:24,716
expected to line the
parade route later.

546
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,508
Incoming Secretary of
State Arnold Vinick is here.

547
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:31,011
Senator Vinick surprised
many Republicans...

548
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:32,758
Surprised everyone
across the board, really...

549
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:35,516
By accepting a position
in Matt Santos' Cabinet.

550
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:37,434
Perhaps eschewing
his own chances

551
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,603
to run again in four years.

552
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,385
It's going to be cold out there.

553
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,610
Yeah.

554
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,213
I hope brevity is in order.

555
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:52,382
I cut the speech down to
about 80 pages in the car.

556
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,285
The Gettysburg Address
was what... four minutes long?

557
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,387
A lot of run-on
sentences though.

558
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,167
Didn't a two hour
inaugural address

559
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,657
kill a President once?

560
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,759
William Henry Harrison,

561
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,728
but, you know, he was 68.

562
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:06,463
He refused to wear a coat.

563
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,243
You refused to wear a coat.

564
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,767
But I'm wearing long underwear.

565
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:10,768
Oh.

566
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,819
(<i> honor guard calls order</i>)

567

have taken their positions.

569
00:26:18,694 --> 00:26:20,861
And now here are
President Bartlet

570
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:23,397
and the First Lady making
their way to their seats

571
00:26:23,432 --> 00:26:24,915
on the podium.

572
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:26,695
After eight years
in the White House,

573
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,764
they are officially
handing over the reins

574
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:33,039
to the Santoses in
a few short minutes.

575
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,627
Thought by many to be...

576
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:39,241
C.J., the President's
office just sent this over.

577
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,213
Says it needs to go

578
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:42,227
to the Pardon
Attorney immediately.

579
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:43,978
And critics with his
willingness to use

580
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,253
American force abroad

581
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:49,790
and his aggressive pursuit
for peace on the world stage.

582
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,346
(<i> band playing, crowd cheering</i>)

583
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,121
Man, I hope Janet
Spragens has her TV on.

584
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:06,023
Who? Senior year,

585
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:07,803
she beat me out for
the last varsity spot

586

on the swim team. Guess what?

587
00:27:09,829 --> 00:27:11,829
What? You win.

588
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,916
Though she did get Don Vogel

589
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,707
to take her to the
prom instead of me.

590
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,142
We'll call it even then.

591
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,155
Nah, I'm pretty sure
Janet had to put out

592
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,946
so Don would take her.

of this great nation.

Give our new President

and humility in
the face of triumph.

We pray that this good
and generous country

may be a blessing to
the nations of the world.

Afternoon, sir.

SAM: Hey, Darrell.
Good to see you, sir.

651
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,982
Good to see you, too.

652
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,426
Home, sweet home.

<i>of who's going in and
out of the Oval Office.</i>

655
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,804
The first thing you'll
need to do is establish

656
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:39,550
who'll have walk-in privileges.

657
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:41,319
Usually it's just the First Lady

658
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:42,842
and the Chief of Staff.

659
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,911
At some point, the
President is going to ask you

660
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,614
to take away his
wife's walk-in privileges.

661
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,749
Don't do it, no matter
how much he begs.

662
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:53,035
You have the right to attend
the morning staff meeting.

663
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,839
I never went because
the senior staff was already

664
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:59,976
appropriately intimidated by
my stern visage and dry wit.

665
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,989
But you're young,
you have a baby face.

666
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,598
They are going to try to walk
all over you; you should go.

667
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,659
Your desk sits right
outside this door.

668
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,094
You prepare his schedule,

669
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,830
you decide who goes
in and who doesn't.

670
00:33:20,866 --> 00:33:24,066
Your most frequent
response to any question

671
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:27,336
will be "no."

672
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:30,373
Say it with empathy
and you'll be fine.

673
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:41,451
Where's Mrs. Bartlet?

674
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,486
Already inside the car, sir.

675
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,890
Nice speech.

676
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:47,874
No JFK.

677
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,176
No, but you've got time.

678
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:53,579
I left something
for you on the desk.

679
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:54,775
Just some random thoughts.

680
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,761
I look forward to them, sir.

681
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:00,020
Make me proud, Mr. President.

682
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:02,939
I'll do my best, Mr. President.

685
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:39,375
was he trying to prove by
not wearing an overcoat?

686
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,828
Youth and vigor.

687
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:43,496
He looked like a leader.

688
00:34:43,532 --> 00:34:45,209
He looked like a lunatic.

689
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:49,002
A young and vigorous lunatic.

Hmm?

00:34:55,727 --> 00:34:57,007
You made it.

693
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,547
You're still here.

694
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:04,668
Yeah.

You want to go see a movie?

No, I guess we don't.

Is there even a movie
theater around here?

00:36:12,104 --> 00:36:14,687
I have no idea.

Can't say the feeling's mutual.

Toby Ziegler today. Any comment?

Nope.

Sure, I do.

for most of the next year

while we restore the
marble and original moldings.

We're hoping that this suite

Santos' approval.
